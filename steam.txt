Fixes the macOS menu bar issue in borderless windowed mode.

[b]The Problem:[/b]
The vanilla game on macOS in borderless windowed mode still displays the macOS menu bar, which hides part of the game screen and reduces the usable display area.

[b]The Solution:[/b]
This mod automatically hides the macOS menu bar when borderless windowed mode is enabled, and restores it when disabled. The game window is also properly positioned to avoid the menu bar area. On macOS 15+, it also removes the thin 1px border around the borderless window.

[b]Features:[/b]

[*] Automatically hides macOS menu bar in borderless windowed mode
[*] Removes thin 1px border around window (macOS 15+)
[*] Properly positions game window to avoid menu bar overlap
[*] Automatically restores menu bar when borderless mode is disabled
[*] Only activates on macOS (no effect on other operating systems)
